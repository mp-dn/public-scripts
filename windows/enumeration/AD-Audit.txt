1. **Patch Applications:** Review patch management processes and ensure that they cover all applications within the AD environment.

2. **Patch Operating Systems:** Evaluate the patch management processes for all operating systems.

3. **Antivirus and Antimalware Deployment:** Review the deployment, update processes, and configurations of antivirus and antimalware software across all systems.

4. **Monitor Sensitive AD Objects:** Review monitoring and alerting mechanisms for sensitive AD objects and Windows events related to security.

5. **Protect Sensitive User Accounts:** Review the security controls, access rights, and monitoring procedures for user accounts with access to sensitive data.

6. **Restrict Powerful Accounts:** Review account management practices to ensure powerful accounts are not used on unauthorized systems.

7. **Privileged Groups Membership:** Review group membership policies to ensure that no permanent memberships exist in highly privileged groups.

8. **Temporary Membership Controls:** Evaluate the controls implemented to manage temporary membership in privileged groups.

9. **Secure Administrative Hosts:** Review the security configurations of administrative hosts.

10. **Application Allowlists:** Verify that application allowlists are implemented on domain controllers, administrative hosts, and other sensitive systems.

11. **Critical Assets Identification:** Review the processes for identifying critical assets and the corresponding security and monitoring practices.

12. **Least-Privilege Access Controls:** Assess the implementation of least-privilege, role-based access controls within the directory, its infrastructure, and domain-joined systems.

13. **Legacy Systems Isolation:** Verify that legacy systems and applications are properly isolated from the rest of the network.

14. **Decommissioning Legacy Systems:** Review the procedures for decommissioning legacy systems and applications.

15. **Secure Development Lifecycle Programs:** Review the secure development lifecycle programs for custom applications.

16. **Configuration Management:** Evaluate the configuration management processes, compliance reviews, and settings for new hardware or software versions.

17. **Migration to Pristine Forests:** Verify the migration process of critical assets to pristine forests with stringent security and monitoring requirements.

18. **User Security Simplification:** Evaluate the steps taken to simplify security for end users without compromising security.

19. **Host-Based Firewalls:** Review the implementation and configurations of host-based firewalls.

20. **Device Patching:** Verify that patch management processes cover all devices.

21. **IT Asset Lifecycle Management:** Review the business-centric lifecycle management process for IT assets.

22. **Incident Recovery Plans:** Evaluate the incident recovery plans in place and their readiness for various types of incidents.

This passive review approach will rely on examining the implemented security practices, policies, and configurations, without actively attempting to exploit vulnerabilities. This type of assessment is often part of a broader security audit or compliance review.
