Here, you'll find a collection of generic Industrial Control System (ICS) scripts designed to aid in the robust testing of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). The goal is to provide a comprehensive set of scripts that simulate a wide range of ICS behaviors and potential attack patterns, allowing for the validation and enhancement of IDS detection capabilities.

IMPORTANT CAVEAT: These scripts are powerful tools for testing and should ONLY be run in controlled, isolated test environments. They are not intended for use in production environments, as they could disrupt system operations or violate safety and security policies.

Please feel free to use these scripts to bolster your own IDS testing, and to contribute any modifications or additions that could benefit the community. Remember, the more robust our testing, the stronger our defenses will be.
